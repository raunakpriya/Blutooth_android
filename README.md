The project Bluetooth Messenger is a system developed on android that will enable the users to create profile and chat with server with the help of deviceâ€™s Bluetooth.
Using the system one can create profile, update their status message and even add a profiler picture. The system requires both the device to be connected via Bluetooth.
Every user can chat with this profile and can even transfer text file from one node to another. The communication process that the system exhibits is one-to-many that means users can only chat with the server and not with other users.
Another useful feature of the system is that it maintains all the chat history so one can view it whenever required.
